This is a file use virtual data to simulate the algorthm proposed form the paper,[Tracking the Best Expert in Non-stationary Stochastic Environments, 2016]. I use python 
realize the first algorthm improved UCB. In this method, we repeat UCB many times to adopt changing environment (All rode or machine, have different return distribution 
in each time). The result has proved this conclusion is right, when we check the red line(the end step of each round), we always can observe a relatively low loss.

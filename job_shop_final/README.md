This is a project about scheduling. I realize two complex algorithms by python code and show them by matplotlib function. The first one is Branch and Bround method. This is a good algorithm to approximate scheduling proplems. It apply statistic and big number theorem to estimate huge range of likelihood, and even does't explore all possible result, still can reach a relatively excellent output. However, this methods has a unbelievable bad time complexity, so it would never apply in real world. Another algorithm is Morte carol tree search. This method also use statistic power to measure a good result. But it provide a more general idea that can be apply not only scheduling problems but also many algorithm problems such as resouse distribution. Both of them are very hard to realize by python, I still spend a lot of time to finish it.
